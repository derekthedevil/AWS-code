# AWS EFS Practice Guide

## Prerequisites
- Two EC2 instances running Amazon Linux
- Proper security groups configured for EFS
- AWS CLI configured

## Steps

1. Install EFS Utils on Both EC2 Instances
   ```shell
   sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils
   ```

2. Create Mount Point on Both Instances
   ```shell
   sudo mkdir /efs
   ```

3. Mount EFS
   ```shell
   sudo mount -t efs fs-yourid:/ /efs
   ```

4. Test File Sharing
   - On Instance 1:
     ```shell
     echo "Hello from Instance 1" > /efs/test.txt
     ```
   - On Instance 2:
     ```shell
     cat /efs/test.txt
     ```

5. Verify Shared Access
   - Files created in /efs on either instance should be visible on both instances
